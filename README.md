# F1-2024-Team-Dashboard
This project visualizes the complete performance analysis of Formula 1 constructors (teams) and their drivers across a season.
It was developed in Microsoft Power BI, combining multiple F1 datasets (races, results, constructors, drivers, standings, and status) using Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

The goal of this dashboard is to evaluate team performance, driver consistency, and reliability, giving data-driven insights into what factors lead to success or failure during a race season.

# Key Visuals & Metrics
| Visual                         | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Constructor Nationality**    | Shows team country.                                                                  |
| **Drivers Name (per team)**    | Displays the lineup and identifies the performance balance between teammates.        |
| **Team Rank**                  | Reflects the final standing in the Constructors’ Championship.                       |
| **Wins**                       | Total number of victories secured by each team.                                      |
| **Sum of Points**              | Aggregated points scored across all races — the key performance metric.              |
| **DNF Breakdown**              | Categorizes reasons for race retirements (Finished, +1 lap, +2 lap, accident etc.).  |
| **Points by Driver**           | Highlights contribution of each driver to total team points.                         |
| **Driver Reliability**         | Measures how often a driver completes races — a key factor for team stability.       |
| **Finish Rate**                | Percentage of races finished successfully — shows mechanical and driver consistency. |
| **No. of Podiums**             | Total times the team finished in top 3 — a success consistency metric.               |
| **Average Finishing Position** | Indicates performance stability across races.                                        |


# Key Insights

Top-performing teams consistently score high in points, wins, and podium finishes, showing a balance between driver skill and car reliability.
Driver reliability and finish rate strongly correlate with overall team ranking — proving that finishing consistently is more valuable than occasional wins.
DNF (Did Not Finish) breakdowns highlight mechanical weaknesses — for example, some teams lose many points due to engine or gearbox failures.
Teams with balanced point contribution between both drivers perform better overall — indicating teamwork is as vital as individual skill.
Constructor nationality analysis shows that European teams dominate performance metrics, reflecting resource advantage and engineering excellence.
Average finishing position provides a quick glance at competitiveness — lower averages indicate podium contention throughout the season.
